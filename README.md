## üí° About the project

> _This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves. To make this happen, you will have to manipulate various sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for optimized data sorting._
### What is push_swap?
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed you‚Äôll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting..

To clean all files generated binary files while doing a make, go to the path and run:

```bash
 make clean
```

**2. Cleaning all binary (.o) and executable files (.a)**

To clean all files generated while doing a make, go to the path and run:

```bash
 make fclean
```

**3. Cleaning all binary (.o) and executable files (.a) in all directories**

To clean all files generated while doing a make, go to the path and run:

```bash
 make ffclean
```

**4. Checking Norminette standart**

To check Norminette errors of all files, simply go to the path and run:

```bash
 make norm
```

**5. Running tester**

To run the tester simply clone tester repository to the same folder below and run:

```bash
 make test
```

**6. Visualizing algorithm**
